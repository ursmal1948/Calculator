## This program performs basic mathematical operations based on input provided in a JSON file and outputs the results in a text file. The supported operations are:
- Addition (add)
- Substraction (sub)
- Multiplication (mul)
- Square root (sqrt)

## The program reads operations from an input.json file, executes the operations, and writes the results in output.txt. The results in the output.txt file are sorted in ascending order based on the result of each operation.
